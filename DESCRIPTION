Description: The HyperSBM package contains functions to specify and fit Stochastic Blockmodel for hypergraphs. It allows performing model-based clustering when the relationship among nodes are not limited to pairwise interactions (edges in graphs), but include higher-order interactions among three or more nodes (hyperedges). The main function relies on a variational implementation of the expectation-maximization algorithm to perform model parameters and latent groups estimation. It also provides tools for generating hypergraphs according to a simplified latent structure (affiliation sub-model).
